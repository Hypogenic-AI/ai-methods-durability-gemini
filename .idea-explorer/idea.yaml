  title: Measuring the "Durability" of Methods in AI Research
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'It is possible to systematically measure the "durability" of AI research
    methods by comparing their performance against newer state-of-the-art models.
    Methods that are outperformed by newer models can be flagged as deprecated, while
    those that remain competitive are marked as durable, helping to identify which
    research contributions remain practically relevant over time.

    '
  background:
    description: "The rapid pace of AI research has led to a large number of papers\
      \ that risk becoming outdated as soon as stronger models are released. This\
      \ creates a relevancy crisis, where many methods are technically reproducible\
      \ but may no longer be worth running. The idea is to develop a tool that can\
      \ automatically assess the \"shelf life\" of a paper's method by comparing it\
      \ to current state-of-the-art models. If the newer models outperform the original\
      \ method, the paper is flagged as deprecated; if not, it is marked as durable.\
      \ This approach aims to help filter out \"zombie papers\"\u2014methods that\
      \ are reproducible but no longer practically useful\u2014while acknowledging\
      \ that some papers may still offer durable insights or efficiency gains even\
      \ if their performance is surpassed."
