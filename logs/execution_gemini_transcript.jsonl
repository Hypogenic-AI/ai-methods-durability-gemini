DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you.

The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need.

Methods that are outperformed by newer models can be flagged as deprecated, while those that remain competitive are marked as durable, helping to identify which research contributions remain practically relevant over time.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nThe rapid pace of AI research has led to a large number of papers that risk becoming outdated as soon as stronger models are released. This creates a relevancy crisis, where many methods are technically reproducible but may no longer be worth running. The idea is to develop a tool that can automatically assess the \"shelf life\" of a paper's method by comparing it to current state-of-the-art models. If the newer models outperform the original method, the paper is flagged as deprecated; if not, it is marked as durable. This approach aims to help filter out \"zombie papers\"—methods that are reproducible but no longer practically useful—while acknowledging that some papers may still offer durable insights or efficiency gains even if their performance is surpassed.\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow. Follow each phase carefully.\n\nIMPORTANT: Resources have been pre-gathered for you!\nCheck your workspace for:\n- literature_review.md: Synthesized literature review\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available resources\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets\n- code/: Cloned repositories and baseline code\n\nUse these resources to inform your experimental design.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                        RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPHASE 1: PLANNING\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBefore writing any code, create a detailed research plan:\n\n1.

Why?\n- Are the results I'm seeing reasonable?\n- Should I stop and debug, or continue?\n- Am I documenting as I go?\n\nDURING ANALYSIS:\n- Am I being objective?\n- What alternative explanations exist?\n- Am I cherry-picking results?\n- What evidence would change my conclusion?\n\nDURING DOCUMENTATION:\n- Can someone else reproduce this?\n- Have I explained my reasoning?\n- Are my claims supported by evidence?\n- What questions would a reviewer ask?\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                             ERROR HANDLING\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Data Problems\n   - Document the issue\n   - Investigate root cause\n   - Decide: fix data, adjust method, or document as limitation\n   - Don't ignore or work around silently\n\n2. Implementation Bugs\n   - Add debugging prints\n   - Test components independently\n   - Use assertions to catch errors early\n   - Don't proceed until fixed\n\n3. Unexpected Results\n   - Don't immediately assume error\n   - Investigate thoroughly\n   - Check for common issues (data leakage, bugs, etc.)\n   - Consider if finding is actually interesting\n   - Document in \"surprises\" section\n\n4. Resource Constraints\n   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments\n   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming\n   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models\n   - Document what you couldn't complete\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRemember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication & Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration & Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=\"gpt-4\"):\n    \"\"\"Robust API calling with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2. Data Organization\n\n**Input Data**\n```\ndatasets/\n├── raw/\n│   ├── benchmark_v1.json          # Original benchmark\n│   ├── custom_test_set.jsonl      # Custom evaluation set\n│   └── prompts/\n│       ├── baseline_prompt.txt\n│       └── optimized_prompt_v3.txt\n├── processed/\n│   └── formatted_for_api.json     # API-ready format\n└── README.md                       # Dataset documentation\n```\n\n**Results Structure**\n```\nresults/\n├── model_outputs/\n│   ├── gpt4_responses.json        # Raw model outputs\n│   ├── claude_responses.json\n│   └── metadata.json              # Model versions, timestamps\n├── evaluations/\n│   ├── automated_scores.json      # Metric scores\n│   ├── human_annotations.csv      # Human eval results\n│   └── error_analysis.md          # Categorized failures\n└── visualizations/\n    ├── performance_comparison.png\n    └── error_breakdown.png\n```\n\n### 3.

This makes it difficult to know which published methods are still relevant and which have been effectively superseded. This research aims to develop a systematic way to measure the \"shelf-life\" or \"durability\" of an AI method. This will help researchers and practitioners focus on methods that provide lasting value.\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\nTo test the main research question, I will focus on a specific, testable hypothesis:\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The performance of a predictive model trained on time-series data will degrade over time as the data distribution shifts (concept drift). This degradation can be detected by an unsupervised degradation indicator, thus providing a measure of the model's \"durability\".\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nI will simulate the aging of an AI model by training it on an early portion of a time-series dataset and then evaluating it on later portions. I will use the Backblaze Hard Drive Stats dataset, as it contains daily snapshots of hard drive health metrics, which is ideal for studying concept drift.\n\nI will implement a simple \"older\" model (Logistic Regression) and a \"newer\" method for detecting data degradation based on the McUDI paper. By comparing the model's actual performance degradation with the degradation predicted by the McUDI-inspired method, I can test if this is a valid way to measure durability.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**\n    *   Download the Backblaze Drive Stats dataset for the year 2015 using the HuggingFace `datasets` library.\n    *   Preprocess the data:\n        *   Handle missing values.\n        *   Select a subset of features for the model.\n        *   Encode categorical features.\n        *   Split the data chronologically into monthly batches.\n\n2.  **\"Older\" Model Implementation:**\n    *   Implement a Logistic Regression model using `scikit-learn`. This will serve as our \"older\" method.\n\n3.  **Initial Model Training:**\n    *   Train the Logistic Regression model on the first month of data (January 2015). This will be our initial \"durable\" model.\n\n4.  **\"Newer\" Method Implementation (McUDI-inspired):**\n    *   Implement the core logic of the McUDI degradation indicator. Based on the paper, this involves:\n        *   Ranking features by importance (e.g., using the coefficients from the trained Logistic Regression model).\n        *   For the most important features, perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to compare the distribution of the feature in the training data (January 2015) with its distribution in a subsequent month's data.\n        *   If the KS statistic is above a certain threshold for any of the key features, flag the model as potentially \"degraded\" for that month.\n\n5.  **Evaluation Over Time:**\n    *   For each subsequent month (February to December 2015):\n        *   Evaluate the performance of the single, initially-trained Logistic Regression model on that month's data. Use metrics like AUC-ROC and F1-score.\n        *   Run the McUDI-inspired degradation check to see if it flags that month's data as drifted.\n\n6.  **Analysis:**\n    *   Plot the model's performance (AUC-ROC) over the 12 months.\n    *   On the same plot, indicate which months were flagged as \"degraded\" by the McUDI indicator.\n    *   Analyze the correlation: Does the McUDI flag precede or coincide with a significant drop in model performance?\n\n### Baselines\n*   **Static Model:** The Logistic Regression model trained only on January 2015 data serves as our primary subject of study. Its changing performance over time is what we are trying to measure.\n*   **Degradation Indicator:** The primary baseline for the degradation indicator is its own ability to predict a performance drop. Success is defined as the indicator's flags correlating with actual, measured performance drops.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n*   **Model Performance:**\n    *   **AUC-ROC:** Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. This is a good metric for imbalanced classification tasks like failure prediction.\n    *   **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n*   **Degradation Detection:**\n    *   **Correlation:** We will look for a correlation between the McUDI degradation flags and the actual drop in the model's AUC-ROC.\n    *   **Timeliness:** Does the degradation flag appear before the performance drops, giving a timely warning?\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n*   I will use a rolling window to calculate the performance metrics to smooth out noise.\n*   The KS-test p-value will be used to determine if a feature's distribution has significantly drifted. A significance level of p < 0.05 will be used.\n*   I will visually inspect the plots for correlation and report on the observed relationship.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n*   **Supporting the hypothesis:** I expect to see the logistic regression model's performance decrease over the months. I also expect the McUDI-based indicator to flag the months where the data distribution has shifted significantly, and that these flags will align with the periods of performance decline.\n*   **Refuting the hypothesis:** The model's performance might not degrade significantly, or the McUDI indicator might fail to flag the months where performance does drop. This would suggest that this method of measuring durability is not effective for this use case.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n*   **Phase 2: Environment & Data Setup (1-2 hours):**\n    *   Install dependencies.\n    *   Download and preprocess the dataset.\n*   **Phase 3: Implementation (2-3 hours):**\n    *   Implement the Logistic Regression model.\n    *   Implement the McUDI-inspired degradation indicator.\n*   **Phase 4: Experimentation (1-2 hours):**\n    *   Train the initial model.\n    *   Run the evaluation loop for all months.\n*   **Phase 5 & 6: Analysis & Documentation (1-2 hours):**\n    *   Analyze the results.\n    *   Create plots.\n    *   Write the final `REPORT.md`.\n\n## Potential Challenges\n*   **Data Size:** The dataset might be large, requiring efficient data processing.\n*   **Data Quality:** The data might have inconsistencies or require significant cleaning. The `datasets/README.md` already mentioned potential schema inconsistencies.\n*   **McUDI Implementation:** Implementing McUDI from the paper might be challenging without a reference implementation. I will have to make some implementation choices based on my interpretation of the paper.\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The KS-test threshold for flagging drift will need to be chosen carefully.\n\n## Success Criteria\nThe research will be considered successful if I can demonstrate a clear correlation between the output of the McUDI-inspired degradation indicator and the measured performance of the \"older\" logistic regression model on the time-series dataset. This would provide evidence that this is a viable approach for systematically measuring the \"durability\" of an AI method.\n"}}
